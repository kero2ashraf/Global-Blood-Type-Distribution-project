# Global-Blood-Type-Distribution-project

in this project i am talking about blood types distribution all over the world, the columns consists of ( country , all blood types , population) and i have add three columns of 5 like ( Common , Rare , Perdominiant, Continent) 

python packages :
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) geopandas
4) scipy.stats
5) seaborn
6) matplotlib.pyplot

my questions :
1) Give an Overview about the data (cleaning , preparation )?
2) Make EDA to the data ?
3) Make a plot between the country and percentage of Blood type?
4) use melt function to make a dataframe its columns ( Country , Blood Type , Percentage)?
5) Make a boxplot to see the statistics between Blood type and the percentage?
6) Make a choropleth map of O+ blood type percentage all over the world ?
7) Make a bar plot to see the relationship between Continent and the mean blood type percentage?
8) What is the distribution of blood type percentages across continents?
9) Make a correlation matrix between continent and the blood types?
10) Calculate the percentages difference for each continent?
11) make a pie charts about the mean blood type percentages by contient?
12) Make two countplots of Common and Rare blood types all over the world?
13) Make a pie chart to see the percentage of the blood type distribution worldwide?
14) Make a stacked bar chart between continent and the percentage of each blood types across the continent?
15) Make a choropleth map using geopandas to see the Predominant Blood Type Across Countries ?
